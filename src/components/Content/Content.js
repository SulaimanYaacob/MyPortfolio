      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        I am a Web Developer and a student currently pursuing a degree. 2013 was
        the year I started coding and became immersed in the field of coding. My
        primary motivation was to make my own video game, but as time passed, I
        became interested in web development. While I have some coding
        experience, I would not consider myself a skilled programmer at this
        time because I am still honing my skills to become one.
