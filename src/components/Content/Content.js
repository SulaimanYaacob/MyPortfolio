      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        I'm a self taught developer who's striving to be good at what I'm doing.
        I initially graduated with Mechanical Engineering Degree with little
        programming languange, however as years goes by, most of the problem I
        face on my work experience require me to developed an automated
        solution. From Excel formulas, VBA, Python and now JavaScript and the
        frameworks. I'm keen to find out where do we go from this.
